# Update

A few items:
- I've updated both [Visualizations](https://matthewrgonzalez.github.io/AotC/Viz/) and [About](https://matthewrgonzalez.github.io/AotC/about/)
- I've renamed this repo to AotC (Ahead of the Curve). This is purely for aesthetic.
- **New project**

I created a a repository for intializing a directory structure for research projects. The actual results can be explored more in the [README](https://github.com/MatthewRGonzalez/file_structure). 
There's more to be done (*as always...*), but I believe that this can save some time and improve organization for future projects
