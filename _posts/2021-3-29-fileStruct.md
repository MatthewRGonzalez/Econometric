# First R Package!! ðŸŽŠ
## Woot Woot
[This](https://github.com/MatthewRGonzalez/fileStruct) repository/funcationality is incredibly similar to that of my last post (I have since made the previous repository private). There's **STILL** more to be done (*as always...*),

### Notes:

- Developing the documentation can be a little tricky, but ended up working out fine. 
- ```devtools::install_github(() ``` works well for installing th...e package.
- Now I should really get back to my problem sets
