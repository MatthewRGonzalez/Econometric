# Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my first attempt at developing a blog. 

My goal here is to stay up to date in uploading proofs/problems/references related to econometrics such that I will have essentually a manuscript when the time comes to take the comps *shudder*. For now, I hope to use this as a space where I can experiment and learn.

Until I get a chance to upload more, please check out some [resources](https://matthewrgonzalez.github.io/Econometric/resources/) that have gottent me this far :smile:
