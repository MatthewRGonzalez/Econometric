# What I've been up to:

For the 0 people who actually follow this blog, I wanted to share some of my recent success with
developing an IDE-type environment with Vim, and then NVIM. In an attempt to actually utilize this site more often, I felt
that I can probably share an interesting NVIM setup for development in both Python3 and R.

# Why NVIM? What NVIM? Who cares?

Theres really not an amazing explanation as to why I've been interested in switching over to an advanced text
editor instead of my typical [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/mrgonzal-SU/Visualizations/blob/master/Centro_Scrapes.ipynb)
setup. To be completely honest, I am still a huge fan of Jupyter notebooks, especially with the markdown support and ease of access/use. Yet, still I've just started switching over to nvim.
At some point during my undergraduate career, a LSP fanatic, and math guru that I often had class with suggested the use of EMACS and VIM, before going on for a really long time about the various functionalities that might lead to and ridiculous increase of my productivity.

For 10 minutes, I was inspired but after setting up running "vim" in terminal, I got stuck, couldn't escape, raged and never looked back..

Well, until now.

At some point during this semester, I accidentally opened Vim again, though this time I was less terrified, and more curious.


Thanks mostly to ~~~ vimtutor ~~~ and the wonders of Youtube, I've worked in the new environment to develop proficiency in motions, commands, and scripting in vim.

# Ok but I still don't care, what have you come up with?

Part of what drew me towards working with Vim (and then Neovim) was probably the degree of customizability. Not only am I able so set my own keyboard shortcuts, but I've also had the luxury of change the color scheme, window set up and much more.

Theres obviously a lot that I like in terms of layout and design, but I'm also enjoying the fact that using Vim has forced me to really explore the command line, and have a better understanding of my directory structures, files and much more.

# A final note:

This is just a brief blog to highlight some random new little things that have kept my interest and made me happy. 

It will be better to attach a recorded demo of what I have actually created.

I'll also post my vimrc in the off chance that someone stumbles upon this and is interested.

But for now thats all :wq :)
