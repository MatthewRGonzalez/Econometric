# Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my first attempt at developing a blog. 

My goal here is to stay up to date in uploading proofs/problems/referenes related to econometrics such that I will have essentually a manuscript when the time comes to take the comps *shudder*. Until then, I hope to use this as a space where I can experiment and learn.
